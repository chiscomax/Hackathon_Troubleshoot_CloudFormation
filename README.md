# Hackathon_Troubleshoot_CloudFormation
This hackathon contains a broken cloudformation YAML file which is meant to launch autoscaling group, load balancer, instances, security groups, ELB listener, Custom VPC, public subnet and mappings. The template will also generate outputs.

HACKATHON REQUIREMENT

CloudFormation template to deploy an insecure, highly available Apache website.

Your task is to troubleshoot and fix the CloudFormation template.

To test the application, deploy the template on the CloudFormation console and access the load balancer's DNS name using a web browser of your choice.

Prepare to explain your thought process to receive full marks!


Hint: You do not need to SSH into the EC2 web servers.


Note:

The CloudFormation template should be executed on the CloudFormation console.

The application should be highly available and accessible on port 80.

There is no database associated with the application.

The instance type to be used is t3.micro.
